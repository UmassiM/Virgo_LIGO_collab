Hands-on collaboration with a phd team working on signal processing for Gravitational Wave Interferometers:
The goal of the project was to use existing techniques like fourier analysis, spectrum filtering etc in order to
correctly discriminate signals of interest (in this case long black hole transients).
Specifically, image filters based on the Hough transform of a power spectrum were implemented so to denoise 
a specific patterns and ranges of frequency.
Being an old project where a MAIN Matlab code which organically calls many complicated external functions, 
I wouldn't dare looking at the code today
